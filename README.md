### Project Background 
The US Debt Tracker project leverages Excel to analyze historical and recent trends
in the United States&#39; debt. By organizing, cleaning, and analyzing publicly available
data, this project provides valuable insights into the nation&#39;s financial health. It
highlights key metrics such as total debt over time, debt-to-GDP ratios, and year-
over-year growth, empowering stakeholders to understand the implications of debt
levels on economic sustainability.

### Goals and Objectives
1. Explore Debt Trends: Analyze the growth of US debt over time and identify
significant patterns.
2. Identify Key Metrics: Calculate and interpret metrics such as debt-to-GDP
ratio and annual growth rates.
3. Clean and Organize Data: Ensure accuracy and reliability through thorough
data cleaning.
4. Visualize Findings: Use Excel to create clear and engaging charts for
stakeholder presentations.

### Analysis Steps
1. Data Cleaning:
o Handled missing or incorrect data using techniques like interpolation
and formula validation.
o Removed redundant entries to ensure a consistent dataset.
2. Trend Analysis:
o Tracked total debt over decades to identify growth patterns and periods
of significant change.
3. Key Metrics Calculation:
o Debt-to-GDP Ratio: Determined the percentage of debt relative to the
national GDP for each year.
o Year-over-Year Growth: Calculated annual changes in debt to highlight
rapid increases or decreases.

4. Visualization:
o Created dynamic charts to depict:
 Debt growth over time.
 Year-on-year debt changes.
 Debt-to-GDP ratio trends.

Key Insights
1. Debt Growth Over Time:
o The US debt has seen exponential growth over the last two decades,
with significant increases during economic downturns and global
crises.

3. Debt-to-GDP Trends:
o The debt-to-GDP ratio crossed critical thresholds during major
recessions, reflecting increased government borrowing to stabilize the
economy.

4. Year-on-Year Variability:
o Annual debt growth rates fluctuated, with the highest spikes observed
during periods of emergency fiscal spending.

### Recommendations
1. Fiscal Policy Optimization:
o Implement strategies to balance growth-oriented fiscal spending with
debt control.

3. Debt Management:
o Monitor debt-to-GDP ratios and align government borrowing with
sustainable economic expansion.

5. Transparency in Debt Reporting:
o Enhance public awareness through regular updates on debt levels and
their implications for economic stability.
